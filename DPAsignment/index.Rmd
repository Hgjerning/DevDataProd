## Outline

The purpose of this exercise is to illustrate Interactive data analysis

 
 * We are going to explore fuel efficiency for cars
 
 * For this purpose I have chosen the very familiar dataset mtcars
 
 * We are using a simple interactive regression model with three variables:
 
                * Number of cylinders
                * Horsepower
                * Weight
                
 * to explain fuel consumption for a sample of cars

## Slide 3

```{r}
#   library(UsingR)
     predModel <- lm (mpg ~ cyl + hp + wt, data=mtcars)
     predModel
```

## Slide 4

Findings:

* Adjusting the three variables used in the analysis gives an idea of the sensitivity of the variables

* this exercise was more for illustrating interactive analysis rather than in dept analysis so

* have a go.............
